# MD380-Codeplug
Classes for handling .rdt codeplug files for Tytera MD-380 (and possibly other) radios.

## Warning

This software can be used to generate a .rdt codeplug file which can be written
to a Tytera MD-380 radio.  This has not been thoroughly tested yet, and there
may be a risk of damage to your radio.  You have been warned, and it ain't my
fault if you hose your radio, mkay?

## Codeplug

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const Codeplug = require('/path/to/MD380-Codeplug/index.js');

// Load an existing codeplug
const codeplug = new Codeplug(fs.readFileSync('/path/to/some/codeplug.rdt'));
// Show the current radio name
console.log(codeplug.settings.radio_name);
// Change the radio name
codeplug.settings.radio_name = 'Poopypants';
// Write the modified codeplug to another file
fs.writeFileSync('/path/to/my/newcodeplug.rdt', codeplug.serialize());

// Create a blank codeplug
const newplug = new Codeplug();
// Change some settings
newplug.settings.radio_name = "MD-380";
newplug.settings.radio_id = 1234567;
// Write it to a file
fs.writeFileSync('/path/to/my/othercodeplug.rdt', newplug.serialize());
```

### Methods

- serialize()
  - Returns a Buffer which can then be written to a file

### Properties

See _lib/map.js_ for names and types of sub-properties which can be read and
written.

- settings
- text_messages
- contacts
- receive_groups
- zones
- scan_lists
- channels

## Notes

When creating an instance of Codeplug, you can pass in a Buffer containing the
contents of a codeplug file.  If you do not pass in a Buffer, a default codeplug
will be loaded from _lib/default1.rdt_.  This default codeplug was generated by
the CPS MD380 Programming Software V1.34 for Windows, for a 400-480MHz MD-380,
MCU Version D013.020.

Certain sections of the codeplug file format have not yet been mapped.  These
include areas related to the 'Basic Information', 'Menu Item', 'Buttons
Definitions', 'Privacy Setting', 'Digit Emergency System', and 'DTMF Signalling'
settings.  Whatever these sections contain in the codeplug file that you loaded
(or in the default codeplug, if you didn't pass in a Buffer) will remain
unchanged in the codeplug Buffer that you generate with Codeplug.serialize().

I have no idea what the ramifications might be of reading in a codeplug file
from one type of radio (a UHF MD-380, for example), modifying it, writing it,
then uploading it to a different model of radio (a VHF MD-380, for example), or
what differences there may be between codeplugs with different "MCU Version"
settings in the 'Basic Information' area.
